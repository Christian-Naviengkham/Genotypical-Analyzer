# This program calculates a user's genetic risk percentage for developing heart disease.

# It does the following:
# 1. Asks the user if they have a family history of heart disease, which affects the risk multiplier.
# 2. Prompts the user to enter genotypes for 23 unique SNPs.
# 3. Validates each genotype to ensure it follows the correct format.
# 4. Compares each user-provided genotype to a corresponding known "risk allele.”
# 5. Increments a risk score if the user's genotype includes the matching risk allele.
# 6. Uses a risk factor to weigh the score.
# 7. Outputs the final genetic risk as a percentage likelihood of developing heart disease.
